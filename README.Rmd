## Overview

The package `eve` is an evolution emulator which provides pipelines to
do phylogenetic-diversity-dependent simulation, analyse outputs and
generate publication-ready plots and statistics conveniently. 

`eve` supports mainly three different scenarios, the species diversification process is regualated by ***phylogenetic diversity (PD)*** or ***evolutionary distinctiveness (ED)*** or ***nearest neighbor distance (NND)*** respectively. 

`eve` supports parallel computing , this feature is implemented with [furrr](https://furrr.futureverse.org/), read through its documentation before using this feature. Note that parralel computing may use a huge amount of memory and may have large overhead.

## Installation

You can install the developmental version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) by running the following commands in R console:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("EvoLandEco/eve")
```


## Example


```{r combo}
library(eve)

# make a combo of parameter sets
combo <- edd_combo_maker(
  la = c(0.5, 0.8),
  mu = c(0.1, 0.2),
  beta_n = c(-0.001, 0),
  beta_phi = c(-0.001, 0.001),
  gamma_n = c(-0.001, 0.001),
  gamma_phi = c(-0.001, 0.001),
  age = 5,
  model = "dsde2",
  metric = c("ed"),
  offset = "none"
)

# have a look at the combo
combo[1:3]
```

All the unique and possible combinations of parameters will be created automatically. 

`eve` supports parallel simulation, the following example shows how to do a 8-session parallel EDD simulation given the combo, with 3 replications for each parameter set . The result will be saved to `/result/example`. If `name` is not specified, a folder will be created according to time and date at the moment. 

```{r edd_go}
# result will be save as .RData file
edd_go(
  combo = combo,
  nrep = 3,
  name = "example",
  strategy = future::multisession,
  workers = 8
)
```

`edd_go` will not return any object unless you set `name = "no_save"`.

``` r
# set name = "no_save" if you want to assign the output to a variable
output <- edd_go(
  combo = combo,
  nrep = 3,
  name = "no_save",
  strategy = future::multisession,
  workers = 8
)

# examine the result
output[[1]]
```

Sequential simulation is also possible:

```{r sequential}
edd <- edd_go(
    combo = combo,
    nrep = 3,
    name = "example2",
    strategy = future::sequential,
    workers = 8
  )
```
