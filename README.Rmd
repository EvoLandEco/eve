## Overview

The package `eve` is an evolution emulator which provides pipelines to do phylogenetic-diversity-dependent simulation, analyse outputs and generate publication-ready plots and tables conveniently. It serves as a companion package to [DDD](https://github.com/rsetienne/DDD) and [DAISIE](https://github.com/rsetienne/DAISIE) now, and maybe expanded to accommodate more models and functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rsetienne/DDD@tianjian_Rampal")
remotes::install_github("EvoLandEco/eve")
```

## Example

`eve` now only supports EDD simulation from the `DDD` package. The first thing to do is to generate a combo consists of all the parameter sets we need:

```{r combo}
library(eve)

# make a combo of parameter sets
combo <- edd_combo_maker(
  la = c(0.5, 0.8),
  mu = c(0.1, 0.2),
  beta_n = c(-0.001, 0),
  beta_phi = c(-0.001, 0.001),
  gamma_n = c(-0.001, 0.001),
  gamma_phi = c(-0.001, 0.001),
  age = 5,
  model = "dsde2",
  metric = c("ed"),
  offset = "none"
)

# have a look at the combo
combo[1:3]
```

A large combo may take too long to finish, as an example a minimal combo will do:

```{r minimal_combo}
# make a minimal combo
combo <- edd_combo_maker(
  la = c(0.5, 0.8),
  mu = c(0.1, 0.2),
  beta_n = -0.001,
  beta_phi = -0.001,
  gamma_n = 0.001,
  gamma_phi = 0.001,
  age = 5,
  model = "dsde2",
  metric = "ed",
  offset = "none"
)
```

`eve` supports parallel simulation, the following example shows how to do a 8-session parallel EDD simulation given the combo, with 3 replications for each parameter set . The result will be saved to `/result/example`. If `name` is not specified, a folder will be created according to time and date at the moment. 

```{r edd_go}
# result will be save as .RData file
edd_go(
  combo = combo,
  nrep = 3,
  name = "example",
  strategy = future::multisession,
  workers = 8
)
```

`edd_go` will not return any object unless you set `name = "no_save"`.

``` r
# set name = "no_save" if you want to assign the output to a variable
output <- edd_go(
  combo = combo,
  nrep = 3,
  name = "no_save",
  strategy = future::multisession,
  workers = 8
)

# examine the result
output[[1]]
```

Sequential simulation is also possible:

```{r sequential}
edd <- edd_go(
    combo = combo,
    nrep = 3,
    name = "example2",
    strategy = future::sequential,
    workers = 8
  )
```
